## Description

A new and upcoming water bottle supplier is having an 'unlimited samples day' of their product where you as a store owner and buyer will be able to take any combination of water bottles with you as long as it all fits in a duffel bag the supplier provides you. This duffel bag can hold limited weight and you want to make off with the most valuable haul possible.

While the supplier has a limited number of types of water bottles, they do have an unlimited supply of each type. Each type of water bottle has a weight and a value, stored in a tuple with two indices:

```
0. An integer representing the weight of the water bottle in ounces. 
1. An integer represeting the monetary value of the water bottle in USD
```

For example:
```python
# Weighs 13 ounces and has a value of $50
(13, 50)
```

Write a function max_duffel_bag_value() that takes a list of water bottle type tuples and a weight capacity and returns the maximum monetary value the duffel bag can hold. 

For example: 
```python 
bottle_tuples = [(7, 160), (3, 90), (2, 15)]
capacity    = 20

max_duffel_bag_value(bottle_tuples, capacity)
# Returns 555 (6 of the middle type of bottle and 1 of the last type of bottle) 
```

Weights and values may be any non-negative integer. Yes, it is weird to think about water bottles that weigh nothing or duffel bags that can not hold anything. But we are not just super mastermind criminals â€” we are also meticulous about keeping our algorithms flexible and comprehensive.

```python
def water_bottle(list, capacity):
    for btl in list:
        if btl[0] == 0 and btl[1] != 0:
            return float('inf')
    if capacity == 0:
        return 0

    annotated_list = [(weight, price, price/weight) for (weight, price) in list]
    annotated_list.sort(key=itemgetter(0))
    annotated_list.sort(key=itemgetter(2), reverse=True)

    bottles_picked = []
    cap = capacity
    for bottle in annotated_list:
        for _ in range(int(cap / bottle[0])):
            bottles_picked.append(bottle)
        cap = cap % bottle[0]
        if cap == 0:
            break

    # uncomment to see the selected bottles
    # print("picked bottles :", bottles_picked)

    return sum([price for (weight, price, ratio) in bottles_picked])
```

```python
def max_duffel_bag_value_helper(bottle_tuples, capacity, total_value):
    
    if len(bottle_tuples) == 0:
        return 0
    
    if capacity == 0:
        return 0
    
    bottle_weight = bottle_tuples[0][0]
    bottle_value = bottle_tuples[0][1]
    
    if len(bottle_tuples) == 1:
        num_bottles = math.floor(capacity / bottle_weight)
        last_value = bottle_tuples[0][1] * num_bottles
        return total_value + last_value
    
    if capacity - bottle_weight <= 0:
        return total_value

    return max(max_duffel_bag_value_helper(bottle_tuples, capacity-bottle_weight, total_value+bottle_value),
        max_duffel_bag_value_helper(bottle_tuples[1:], capacity-bottle_weight, total_value+bottle_value))

def max_duffel_bag_value(bottle_tuples, capacity):
    
    total_value = 0
    
    return max(max_duffel_bag_value_helper(bottle_tuples, capacity, total_value),
        max_duffel_bag_value_helper(bottle_tuples[1:], capacity, total_value))
```
## Recursive Solution 
```python
def max_duffel_bag_value(bottle_tuples, capacity):
    return mdbv(bottle_tuples, capacity,0)
    
def mdbv(bottle_tuples, capacity, acc_value):
    bottle_tuples = [(weight, value) for (weight,value) in bottle_tuples if weight <= capacity]

    if bottle_tuples == []:
        return acc_value
        
    (weight,value) = bottle_tuples[0]
    return max( mdbv(bottle_tuples,capacity-weight,acc_value + value),
                mdbv(bottle_tuples[1:],capacity,acc_value))

```
